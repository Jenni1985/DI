# Write a class called ForceWielder which has the following attributes:
# # - name (string) accept it as an argument from the user
# # - power (an integer) randomly generated between 1 and 15
# # # - wisdom (an integer) randomly generated between 1 and 15
# and the following method:
# â€‹
# - train (implement it as an abstract method)
# - fight method, two ForceWielder can fight, the winner is the one with the highest harmonic mean between power and wisdom (check out the definition of harmonic mean !)
# - is_jedi method (also abstract method)
# 2) Write a two child class (they inherit from ForceWielder) Jedi and Sith:

# - Jedi has new features:
# - Lightsaber color attribute: if wisdom is higer than power then it is green, if power is higher than wisdom then blue, if they are equal then violet
# - wisdom goes up 10 points
# - the train method when called adds randomly between 10 and 20 points to wisdom and between 5 and 15 points of power
